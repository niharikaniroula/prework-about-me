      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an easy-going, creative, old soul, always with her head in the clouds. I have an affinity for all things cosmic and a good cup of matcha. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Nepal but I lived in Seychelles, San Francisco, and Alameda until my family settled down in Sacramento!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love cooking, reading, hiking, traveling, trying different craft beers, creating digital and non-digital art, and watching true-crime documentaries and shows when I have free time. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would to be a travel and food blogger but more realistically, a nurse anesthetist with a web development consulting side business. It sounds like two very conflicting and time consuming careers but it's a combination of two things I love - coding and medicine! </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live close to downtown Sacramento. I love downtown Sacramento for all the amazing restaurants, cool bars and breweries, chic coffee shops, and niche local shops. I love it here!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I love all the work and detail that goes into designing and creating websites and platforms. Also, I think being able to code is a useful skill to have, especially in our current tech-forward society. </p>
